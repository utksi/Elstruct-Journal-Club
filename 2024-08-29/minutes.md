Simulations can greatly accelerate the identification, characterization and optimization of materials, with this acceleration driven by continuous progress in theory, algorithms and hardware, and by adaptation of concepts and tools from computer science. Nevertheless, the capability to identify and characterize materials relies on the predictive accuracy of the underlying physical descriptions, and on the ability to capture the complexity of realistic systems. We provide here an overview of electronic-structure methods, of their application to the prediction of materials properties, and of the different strategies employed towards the broader goals of materials design and discovery.

Abstract - 

The presence of spin-polarized charge carriers in metallic magnets provides a mechanism for spin-lattice interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling.

<summary>See More...</summary>
Here, we present a theory of this mechanism used to estimate its effect on the exchange interactions in 2D magnets. Starting from a square lattice model at half filling, we show that the presence of electron-phonon coupling with equilibrium phonon distribution leads to a notable suppression of exchange interactions with temperature. We then apply our approach to the prototypical 2D metallic ferromagnet, Fe3GeTe2, with moderate electron-phonon coupling. We find that the exchange interactions undergo a renormalization, leading to a softening of the magnon modes, and suppression of the Curie temperature by ‚àº10\%. We expect that this effect can be further enhanced in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, as well as for non-equilibrium distribution of phonons induced by strong laser fields or charge currents.

### Ephemeral data derived potentials for random structure search [Read](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.014102)

- Chris J. Pickard Phys. Rev. B **106**, 014102 (2022)

Abstract - 

Structure prediction has become a key task of the modern atomistic sciences and depends on the rapid and reliable computation of energy landscapes. 
<details>
<summary>See More...</summary>
First-principles density functional based calculations are highly reliable, faithfully describing entire energy landscapes. They are, however, computationally intensive and slow compared to interatomic potentials. Great progress has been made in the development of machine learning, or data derived, potentials, which promise to describe entire energy landscapes at first-principles quality. Compared to first-principles approaches, their preparation can be time consuming and delay searching. Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) is a straightforward and powerful approach to structure prediction, based on the stochastic generation of sensible initial structures and their repeated local optimization. Here, a scheme, compatible with AIRSS, for the rapid construction of disposable, or ephemeral, data derived potentials (EDDPs) is described. These potentials are constructed using a homogeneous, separable many-body environment vector and iterative neural network fits, sparsely combined through non-negative least squares. The approach is first tested on methane, boron nitride, elemental boron, and urea. In the case of boron, an EDDP generated using data from small unit cells is used to rediscover the complex ùõæ-boron structure without recourse to symmetry or fragments. Finally, an EDDP generated for silane (```math $SiH_4$```) at 500 GPa enables the discovery of an extremely complex, dense structure which significantly modifies silane's high pressure phase diagram. This has implications for the theoretical exploration for high temperature superconductivity in dense hydrides, which have so far largely depended on searches in smaller unit cells.

### Anomalies in particle physics and their implications for physics beyond the standard model [Read](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00703-6)

- Andreas Crivellin and Bruce Mellado, Nat. Rev. Phys. volume **6**, pages 294‚Äì309 (2024)

Abstract - 

The standard model (SM) of particle physics is the mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter. 
<details>
<summary>See More...</summary>
Its last missing particle, the Higgs boson, was observed in 2012. However, there are several phenomena that the SM cannot account for (such as dark-matter particles, or non-vanishing neutrino masses), neither does it describe gravity. There must be more to discover, to extend the SM into a full description of nature. Here we review the hints of new physics, called anomalies, that are seen for various interactions as discrepancies between standard-model predictions and experimental measurements. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new particles at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies span an energy scale of more than four orders of magnitude: from the mass of the proton, to the electroweak scale (approximately the mass of the Higgs boson), to the teraelectronvolt scale, which is the highest scale directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. We discuss the experimental and theoretical status of various anomalies and summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions as well as discovery prospects. We suggest, in particular, that new additional Higgs bosons and so-called leptoquarks are promising candidates for extending the standard model.

### Dark states of electrons in a quantum system with two pairs of sublattices [Read](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02586-x)

- Yoonah Chung et al., Nature Physics (2024)

Abstract -

A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. 
<details>
<summary>See More...</summary>
This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed-matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarization and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarized into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead halide perovskites and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.

### Coherent Acoustic Control of Defect Orbital States in the Strong-Driving Limit [Read](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.030336)

- B.A. McCullian, V. Sharma, H.Y. Chen, J.C. Crossman, E.J. Mueller, and G.D. Fuchs, PRX Quantum **5**, 030336 (2024)

Abstract - 

We use a bulk acoustic wave resonator to demonstrate coherent control of the excited orbital states in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center at cryogenic temperature. 
<details>
<summary>See More...</summary>
Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multiphonon orbital Rabi oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement between our measurements, quantum master-equation simulations, and a Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus the acoustic drive strength that is nonperturbative in the drive strength and agrees well with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuous-wave spin-resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured few-to-several-nanoseconds orbital decoherence times. We discuss the outlook for orbital decoherence protection.

### Improving equations of state calibrations in the toroidal DAC‚ÄîThe case study of molybdenum [Read](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0223794)

Abstract - 

We report an updated isothermal equation of state (EoS) of molybdenum (Mo) obtained by compression in beveled and toroidal diamond-anvil cells (DACs). 
<details>
<summary>See More...</summary>
For an improved compression environment, we developed a copper (Cu) pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) for the toroidal diamond-anvil cell samples, as it is a soft metal compared to Mo with a well calibrated EoS. A Ne PTM was used for the conventional beveled DAC samples. The unit-cell volumes of Mo were measured to 336(1)‚ÄâGPa in the Cu PTM and 231.2(6)‚ÄâGPa in the Ne PTM at room temperature. We additionally calculated elastic stiffness and compliance constants and evaluated the uniaxial stress of Mo and Cu with pressure. A new EoS for Mo is presented from data collected in all sample environments and compared to our theoretical predictions as well as previous compression studies of Mo. The (200) lattice plane of Mo produced the lowest volumes across the pressure range of this study for all compression environments, suggesting that it is less affected by nonhydrostatic stresses in the DAC compared to the other observed diffraction planes. The presented Mo EoS is compatible with extrapolations of EoS fits of Mo in helium (He) within ‚àº1% at 330‚ÄâGPa. Results from this work demonstrate that compressing a sample in a softer metal in the toroidal DAC can improve the compression environment and result in measured sample volumes comparable to those collected in noble-gas media at multi-megabar conditions.
